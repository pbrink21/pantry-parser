This project was for COMS 309 here at Iowa State University. We are using Springboot (and hibernate) for our back-end and the Java Android SDK for the front-end app. This app is a recipe app where you can select what ingredients you have and from that youâ€™ll see what recipes you can make. We have things like a full auth system with permissions, encryption and hashing, and recipe creation and management, favoriting, recipe browsing, and more all through the app.
